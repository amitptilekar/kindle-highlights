​Another approach worth considering is posting information that isn’t necessarily directly promoting your business, but more relevant information that you think your customers will find useful or informative. It’s an indirect way of increasing the perceived value of what you have to say. Your customer will start to think everything you say is important and helpful if you always strive to provide them with quality information instead of trying to simply sell them something.

use their brand name as a keyword so that when that competitor’s name or product is typed in, your client’s ad appears. To avoid a low quality score for those terms, you can create a page on your site that talks about how your product is similar to the “Kleenex” brand. That way search engines can find the relevance, rank you organically, and the click won’t cost as much in your PPC campaign. This is a great way to steal some of the action from big names in your industry.

You needn't be so awfully put out at that, my man. A country is free to arrange its affairs in its own way. As for roads in our country—well, they are as good as non-existent; narrow and crooked lanes, a labyrinth of ruts and tracks. Our King does not believe in open thoroughfares; he thinks that streets are just so many openings for his subjects to fly away from his kingdom. It is quite the contrary here; nobody stands in your way, nobody objects to your going elsewhere if you like to; and yet the people are far from deserting this kingdom. With such streets our country would certainly have been depopulated in no time. FIRST MAN. My dear Janardan, I have always noticed that this is a great fault in your character. JANARDAN. What is? FIRST MAN. That you are always having a fling at your country.

GREAT WORK BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE  Do your most meaningful creative work at the beginning of your day, and leave “reactive work”—like responding to e-mail or other messages—for later. JUMP-START YOUR CREATIVITY  Establish “associative triggers”—such as listening to the same music or arranging your desk in a certain way—that tell your mind it’s time to get down to work. FEEL THE FREQUENCY  Commit to working on your project at consistent intervals—ideally every day—to build creative muscle and momentum over time. PULSE AND PAUSE  Move rhythmically between spending and renewing your energy by working in ninety-minute bursts and then taking a break. GET LONELY  Make a point of spending some time alone each day. It’s a way to observe unproductive habits and thought processes, and to calm your mind. DON’T WAIT FOR MOODS  Show up, whether you feel inspired or not.

Studies show that the human mind can only truly multitask when it comes to highly automatic behaviors like walking. For activities that require conscious attention, there is really no such thing as multitasking, only task switching—the process of flicking the mind back and forth between different demands. It can feel as though we’re super-efficiently doing two or more things at once. But in fact we’re just doing one thing, then another, then back again, with significantly less skill and accuracy than if we had simply focused on one job at a time.

Mr Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that Mr Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear. ‘Having a good holiday, Dudley?’ he said kindly. Dudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside. Fred and George came back into the room, carrying Harry’s school trunk. They glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley. Their faces cracked into identical, evil grins. ‘Ah, right,’ said Mr Weasley. ‘Better get cracking, then.’ He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand. Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one. ‘Incendio!’ said Mr Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him. Flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours. Mr Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside and threw it onto the flames, which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever.

Harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the kitchen. Dudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr Weasley with terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father. Unfortunately, Uncle Vernon’s bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt Petunia, was nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley. ‘Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?’ said Mr Weasley, taking another brave stab at making conversation. ‘Yep,’ said Harry, ‘that’s Dudley.’ He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming. Dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off. Mr Weasley, however, seemed genuinely concerned at Dudley’s peculiar behaviour. Indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr

Ginny was sitting with him, talking to him in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice. ‘What’s up, Ron?’ said Harry, joining them. Ron looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his face. ‘Why did I do it?’ he said wildly. ‘I don’t know what made me do it!’ ‘What?’ said Harry. ‘He – er – just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him,’ said Ginny.
